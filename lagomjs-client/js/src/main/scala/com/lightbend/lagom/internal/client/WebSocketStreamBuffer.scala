/**
 * Buffers elements received from a WebSocket for consumption by a reactive stream
 *
 * The buffer is implemented as a finite state machine for use in a JavaScript runtime. It prioritizes delivering
 * elements downstream immediately in response to incoming messages and downstream requests. This is to mitigate the
 * impact of fast sockets consuming the event-loop and preventing downstream consumption of messages. It enforces a
 * maximum number of queued elements and will fail the socket and stream if the maximum is exceeded.
 *
 * The buffer has seven states: Queueing, Full, Streaming, Draining, Completed, Cancelled, and Failed.
 *
 * The Queueing state is when the socket is open, the buffer will receive and queue messages, and no subscriber
 * has been attached. The Full state is when the socket is closed, the buffer will not queue more messages, and no
 * subscriber has been attached. The Streaming state is when the socket is open, the buffer will receive and queue
 * messages, a subscriber is attached, and messages are sent to the subscriber in response to its demand signals. The
 * Draining state is when the socket is closed, the buffer will not queue more messages, a subscriber is attached, and
 * messages are sent to the subscriber in response to its demand signals. The Completed state is when the socket is
 * closed, a subscriber is attached, all queued messages have been sent to the subscriber, and the subscriber is
 * completed. The Cancelled state is when a subscriber is attached and cancelled, causing the socket to be closed and
 * any queued messages to be discarded. The Failed state is when the buffer has failed for any reason, causing the
 * socket to be closed, the subscriber to be completed with an error, and any queued messages to be discarded.
