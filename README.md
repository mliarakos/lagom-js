# Lagom.js - Scala.js Client for Lagom

Lagom.js is a port of the [Lagom](https://www.lagomframework.com/) service API and service client to JavaScript using Scala.js. It allows you to use and interact with your service API all in JavaScript. Eliminate the need to keep your frontend in sync with your service API, let lagom.js handle it for you.

Checkout the [lagom-scalajs-example](https://github.com/mliarakos/lagom-scalajs-example) for a demo of how to use lagom.js.

## Compatibility

Lagom.js is built against specific versions of Lagom, the latest are:

| Lagom.js    | Lagom | Scala           | Scala.js |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|----------|
| 0.1.2-1.5.5 | 1.5.5 | 2.11 <br> 2.12  | 0.6.31   |
| 0.3.2-1.6.2 | 1.6.2 | 2.12 <br> 2.13  | 0.6.33   |
| 0.5.0-1.6.4 | 1.6.4 | 2.12 <br> 2.13  | 1.2.0    |

Lagom.js moved to Scala.js 1.x starting with version `0.4.0-1.6.2`. Scala.js 0.6 is no longer supported, the last version to support it was `0.3.2-1.6.2`. For all past releases, see [releases](#Releases).

Lagom.js does not support the Lagom Java API. It only supports the Lagom Scala API because Scala.js only supports Scala.

## Usage

Lagom.js provides JavaScript versions of several Lagom artifacts. The two most important are the service API and service client.

### Service API

The `lagomjs-scaladsl-api` artifact provides the JavaScript implementation of the Lagom service API:

```sbt
"com.github.mliarakos.lagomjs" %%% "lagomjs-scaladsl-api" % "0.5.0-1.6.4"
```

To use it you'll need to configure your service API as a [Scala.js cross project](https://github.com/portable-scala/sbt-crossproject) for the JVM and JS platforms. Then, add the `lagomjs-scaladsl-api` dependency to the JS platform:

```scala
lazy val `service-api` = crossProject(JVMPlatform, JSPlatform)
  .crossType(CrossType.Full)
  .jvmSettings(
    libraryDependencies += lagomScaladslApi
  )
  .jsSettings(
    libraryDependencies += "com.github.mliarakos.lagomjs" %%% "lagomjs-scaladsl-api" % "0.5.0-1.6.4"
  )
```

This enables your Lagom service definition to be compiled into JavaScript. In addition, your domain objects, service requests and responses, and custom exceptions are also compiled into JavaScript. This makes your entire service API available in JavaScript.

### Service Client

The `lagomjs-scaladsl-client` artifact provides the JavaScript implementation of the Lagom service client:

```sbt
"com.github.mliarakos.lagomjs" %%% "lagomjs-scaladsl-client" % "0.5.0-1.6.4"
```

You can use it in a Scala.js project along with your service API to generate a service client:

```scala
lazy val `client-js` = project
  .settings(
    libraryDependencies += "com.github.mliarakos.lagomjs" %%% "lagomjs-scaladsl-client" % "0.5.0-1.6.4"
  )
  .enablePlugins(ScalaJSPlugin)
  .dependsOn(`service-api`.js)
```

The service client can be used to interact with your service by making service calls, just as you normally would in Scala. Since the entire service API is available in JavaScript you have everything you need to create requests and understand responses.

## Features

Lagom.js supports cross compiling the full Lagom service API into JavaScript. The service client supports almost all features available in Lagom:
- all the service call definitions: `call`, `namedCall`, `pathCall`, `restCall`
- serialization of service requests and responses using `play-json`
- streaming service requests and responses using [Akka.js](https://github.com/akka-js/akka.js) and WebSockets
- circuit breakers with basic metrics
- all the built-in service locators: `ConfigurationServiceLocator`, `StaticServiceLocator` and `RoundRobinServiceLocator`

However, the service client does not support a few the features available in Lagom:
- full circuit breaker metrics: circuit breakers are fully supported, but the built-in circuit breaker metrics implementation only collects a few basic metrics
- subscribing to topics: topic definitions are available in the service client, but attempting to subscribe to the topic throws an exception
- advanced service locators: service locators outside of the built-in service locators, such as `AkkaDiscoveryServiceLocator`, are not available

## Configuration

### Application Configuration

Lagom.js uses [shocon](https://github.com/akka-js/shocon) as a Scala.js replacement for [Typesafe Config](https://github.com/lightbend/config). The library loads [default configurations](https://github.com/akka-js/shocon#loading-of-default-configuration) at compile time. If you use an application config (`application.conf`) then you need to fall back to the default Lagom.js config:

```scala
abstract class MyApplication extends StandaloneLagomClientFactory("my-aplication") {
  // Load application config with the lagomjs default config as the fallback
  lazy val conf = ConfigFactory.load().withFallback(lagomjs.Config.default)
  override lazy val configuration: Configuration = Configuration(conf)
}
```

This also applies to parsed configs:

```scala
abstract class MyApplication extends StandaloneLagomClientFactory("my-aplication") {
  // Parse config with the lagomjs default config as the fallback
  lazy val conf = ConfigFactory.parseString("""
    lagom.client.websocket {
      bufferSize = 128
    }""")
    .withFallback(lagomjs.Config.default)
  override lazy val configuration: Configuration = Configuration(conf)
}
```

This approach is based on [Akka.js configurations](https://github.com/akka-js/akka.js#add-ons).

### WebSocket Stream Buffer

Streaming service requests and responses are implemented using WebSockets. When starting a WebSocket connection there is a slight delay between the socket opening and the response stream being set up and ready to consume messages. To compensate for this delay the lagom.js WebSocket client uses a receive buffer to hold messages until the stream is ready. The buffer size can be set through configuration:

```yaml
lagom.client.websocket.bufferSize = 16
```

The buffer is sized by default to compensate for this delay. However, the buffer can also be used for another purpose.

The current WebSocket standard prevents the lagom.js WebSocket client from supporting stream back-pressure for sending or receiving WebSocket data. This can cause overflow errors and stream failure when upstream production is faster than downstream consumption. Normally, standard Akka methods, such as [buffer](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/stream/stream-rate.html), could be used to mitigate this issue. Unfortunately, these methods generally do not perform well in practice because of the way operations are scheduled by the JavaScript event-loop. A fast upstream often fails the stream before the Akka buffer logic has a chance to run.

The lagom.js receive buffer is implemented to schedule downstream consumption on the event-loop as soon as possible to mitigate this issue. The buffer size can be tuned to attempt to compensate for the fast streaming response. This is useful if the upstream has bursts of throughput that can overwhelm the downstream. However, depending on the use case, it may not be possible to fully compensate for stream rate differences. An upstream rate that is consistently faster than the downstream will eventually overflow the buffer. The buffer can be set to an unbounded size:

```yaml
lagom.client.websocket.bufferSize = unlimited
```

However, an unbounded buffer can negatively impact browser performance and will eventually fail due to lack of memory.

Alternatively, if the upstream logic (before data is sent over the WebSocket) can be modified, then the stream can be throttled. For example, in a `ServiceCall` implementation:

```scala
override def zeros = ServerServiceCall { _ =>
  // Throttle the source to 1 element per second
  val source = Source.repeat(0).throttle(elements = 1, 1.second)
  Future.successful(source)
}
```

The `throttle` operator will back-pressure to achieve the desired rate and since the upstream can slow down it will not overwhelm the downstream. The throttle parameters should be tuned per use case.

WebSocket back-pressure for streams may become available once the [WebSocketStream API](https://web.dev/websocketstream/) is complete and widely available.

## Releases

Lagom.js tracks Lagom and generally doesn't continue development on previous Lagom releases. Since Lagom maintains a stable API within a minor release (e.g., 1.6.x) any version of Lagom.js built for that minor release should work. However, if you need Lagom.js for a specific previous Lagom release the previous Lagom.js releases are listed below. If you have an issue with a previous Lagom.js release please open an [issue](https://github.com/mliarakos/lagom-js/issues) and it will be considered on a case-by-case basis.
